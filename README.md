## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools - HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - This helped me for basic HTML. This is my go to resource for all things development. It's a good start for learning the basics of a programing language in general.
- [W3 Schools - CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me for CSS. I find CSS very hard. This is will still be my go-to resource if I am struggling with something else.
